                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings to those who have decided to look me up or just are passing through. My name is Jeremiah and this is a website of my own design to showcase my abilities, references, and interests for potential interested parties. I am both learning to be a web developer as well as a software designer. I am willing to work outside of my field and learn new things if offered a job I may want. I am a quick learner and a hard worker as long as I am treated with respect. I believe in being professional when doing my work and not having emotional issues from outside enter the work place as best as I can.
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of things I prefer in a job would be that the pay will reflect my performance at the job. The job will give me room so I can grow as an individual and advance in my profession. That I will have multiple off days for getting personal things done when I need them to be. Preferably that the people at the job are nice but that is not entirely necessary for the job isn't about them. The only point where loocation becauses a factor is if I do not have the ability to get to the job without waking up before 6:00 am.
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few things that don't matter too much with the job is if it pertains to my field of study or not. If it is a job where I work alone or with a team. If I have a deadline for my work unless the deadlines given are unreasonable. Along with the company's stanceson politics unless it winds up being forced upon me.
              </p>
