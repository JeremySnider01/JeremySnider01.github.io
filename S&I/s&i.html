            <dt> Basic Web Development </dt>
            <dd>
              I am able to design simple websites that can be used to inform or advertise to people on the internet.
            </dd>
            <dt> Quick Learning </dt>
            <dd>
              I pick up skills and abilities quickly and will be able to apply them as long as there is something or someone teaching them to me. This gives me an edge up on training processes and classes.

            <dt> Above average typing </dt>
            <dd>
              I have an average typing speed of roughly 68-70 wpm which allows me to be faster at designing websites, typing up reports, inputting data, and etc. Almost anything that is needed to type I will be able to do

            <dt> Computer Keyboard Shortcuts </dt>
            <dd>
              I know how to use many different keyboard shortcuts to speed up my computer navigation and information gathering.

            <dt> Developing Video games </dt>
            <dd>
              As a profession when I complete my schooling I wish to develope video games that will be published and sold as a professional product. This could be as an indie game or by a Triple A game company; the only hope is that the game will be a well made and enjoyable product for myself and the players.
            </dd>
            <dt> Marketing </dt>
            <dd>
              I have learned about marketing and am interested in going to get a degree in business so I can also have a chance at pursuing a career in marketing for larger companies.
